  "description": "Over $500k has been stolen by hackers that were able to compromise the official frontends of Convex, Ribbon, DeFiSaver and other popular crypto websites. They were able to do this by compromising the Namecheap settings for these websites, either by social engineering or an inside job. The hackers injected malicious approval transactions into the frontend, draining users' wallets. Anyone that interacted with these websites on the 23rd of June is at risk.",
